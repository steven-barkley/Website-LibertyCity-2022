          <p>Only the second building project of its kind Model City was
            even more diverse than it is today. It was home to all the "other colors"
            that the laws of the day segregated. Miami was the home of the working man post depression.
            Everyone was coming into Miami for the steady construction work. As the Miami economy
            and public services were leagues above the rural establishment of the time. During, this
            period American Blacks the "South" and long time residents from Overtown began to pour in.</p>

            urban violence, disillusionment with existing urban renewal programmes,
            and bureaucratic difficulties in the first years of the War on Poverty led to
            calls for reform of federal programmes. The Model Cities initiative created a
            new program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intended
            to improve coordination of existing urban programs.

        <li class="a"> Authorized to Riot, Liberty City resident declare War on Miami</li>
        <article>
          <p>Basically, a well known story about racism and legal abuse of power, is that
            of Author McDuffie. Police (if they even could be called such) were a necessary evil in Miami. The United
            States
            was under siege in the last sixties and early seventies by a Drug Trade that was spilling over its Florida
            border.
            So national money was set a side to accelerate the number of police in the county to match the outbreaks of
            violence
            facing Miami for the very first time since its founding. Great and illustrious criminial made millions from
            corrupting
            this new police force. Author McDuffie's murder was only a symptom of the cancer of Miami's legal arms.
            However, let me
            be perfectly clear the response was equally violent and abusing. People were murdered and the foundation of
            Government
            was marched upon with violent intent. Finally, war powers were evoked and the riots ended but with the City
            of Miami forever
            tramatized by its inability to converge openly with culturally different communities.</p>

        <article>
          <p>All things must end. Even curses are one day broken. In 2015, the City was again experiencing the pangs of
            social poverty
            caused primarily the citizens financial and intellectual fragility. Too many single mom, war veterans,
            pastors, and children live in
            reside in a neighborhood where random crime and poor decisions are common. Someone brought out the
            Landlord's stake in the property. A
            A wealthy experienced real estate mogul from overseas. He came in like a prince on a white horse ready to
            save and up lift the downtridden
            from their ditch called Liberty City.<a

          <p>Finally, the old projects that stood, rusted and rotten for over 80 plus years will be ripped down. A new
            neighborhood will rise
            in its place. The plan for this space is to accelerate the people's heart's and minds who live there. An
            environment that will gentrify <thead>
              historically impoverished from the inside out. Provide opportunity for all through access for all.
